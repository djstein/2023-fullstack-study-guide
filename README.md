## Let's Learn Frontend!

It's TypeScript is JavaScript with extra features!

Basically no one writes plain JavaScript anymore.
JavaScript can be used on the a 'backend' computer (like our Python apps) or _the more normal use: in a web browser_.

###

While TypeScript is useful by itself to add interactivity to their websites, we don't want to build all the tooling ourselves. Instead we'll build on top of other's companies tools for best in class frontend applications.

The best way to build web apps today is with React. Don't be fooled by Vue (a close replica), Angular (overly complex), or Svelt (too new at this point).

The best resource for a quick dive into TypeScript, CSS and their usage is by following Vercel's Next.js introduction guide.
